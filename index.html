      <div class="water-fountain-container">
        <h2>water fountain</h2>
        <p>The green water fountain makes a noise when the water is low. You can add three cups of water to make sure the water is above the inner motor and can be pumped out of the top. Just pour the water from the top and it will flow down into the bottom chamber.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="litter-box-container">
        <h2>litter box</h2>
        <p>I typically clean the litter box twice per day, once in the morning and once before bed (the girls love to poop and it’s super stinky). The litter box is in the credenza under the television. Everything you should need will be in there. The trash chute is located to the right of the elevators if you are facing them.</p>

    <div class="general-cat-info-container">
      <h2>general cat info</h2>
      <p>Recently Ekko - the black kitty, has been sneezing a little from allergies and Rooney - the white kitty, has been bulling her for it. I'm not sure why but if they start fighting just calmly break them up and offer catnip or treats to calm the energy. If that doesn't work, feel free to put Rooney in the bedroom for a bit. If they are fighting and you have to leave, you can put Rooney in the bedroom with a bowl of water and the spare litter box with some litter in it.</p>

          <h2>spare key</h2>
          <p>The spare key is located in the lock box to the right of the front desk. The code will be the last 5 digits of your phone number. If you have trouble you can ask the front desk for help. They cannot retreive the key for you, but they can help troubleshoot the lock box. Once you're inside the apartment, you will have access to my key and can return the spare key. To return the spare key, just tap the black fob to the lock box and it will open. Place the key where the red ring light appears and close the door.</p>

        <div class="building-amenities-container">
          <h2>building amenities</h2>
          <p>There are several amenities in the building you may use, I just ask that you follow all building rules/guidlines, which can be obtained from the front desk. In order to keep everyone safe, I also ask that no one besides yourself is allowed into my apartment. This means guests of yours or the building staff - unless I have given special permission. The front desk will not be allowed to let anyone other than yourself into the apartment. I also ask that you don't bring your pets into my apartment as my lease has a strict 2 pet policy.</p>
